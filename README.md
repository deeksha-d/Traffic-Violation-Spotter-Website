# Traffic-Violation-Spotter-Website
An inital webpage with basic css, javascript, bootstrap and php. 

It has a login page with register option. All the pages are linked seperately and also has a page for uploading files.
The webpage uses backend using SQL and also verifies data through it.

Please ensure that you are using a backend server on your system eg: xampp.

I've used XAMPP and place the file within htdocs folder for php to work properly. 
Also, ensure that your Xampp Server is running with backend as MySQL.
